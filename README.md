Collection of requests in Postman created during the learning process. Includes dynamic variables and simple tests (checking if API gives back '200' code for every request).

PokeAPI is a consumption-only API â€” only the HTTP GET method is available on resources, so all of the requests are using GET method.

## Installation
You can download Postman using [this link](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Postman is an API client that makes it easy to test HTTP requests.

Then you need to import collection from this repository into Postman. Please clone the repo, select Import in your Postman's workspace and choose collection files. You're all set!
